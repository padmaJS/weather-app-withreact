## Title
**Weather app made with ReactJS**
## Description
This is a simple weather app that accepts desired location as per the user to search for the weather with temperature of that location. This is one my very first projects which I did in order to learn more about programming in ReactJS. 
## Installation

    npx create-react-app weather-app
    cd weather-app
    npm start
Then just copy this repository and overwrite the files.
## Instructions
This app is fairly easy to use with one search bar and a search button. Type any location and click on search button. The app will show the Weather and Temperature of the location.
